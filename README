NAME

    Excel::XLSX::Writer - Create a new file in the Excel 2007+ XLSX format.

DESCRIPTION

    *** NOTE. This currently isn't working code. A developer release should
              be available by the end of September, 2010. 

    The Excel::XLSX::Writer module can be used to create a new Excel file
    in the 2007+ XLSX format. 


    Multiple worksheets can be added to a workbook and formatting
    can be applied to cells. Text, numbers, and formulas can be
    written to the cells.

    Excel::XLSX::Writer uses the same interface as Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.

    This module cannot, as yet, be used to write to an existing
    Excel XLSX file.


SYNOPSIS

    To write a string, a formatted string, a number and a formula to
    the first worksheet in an Excel XML spreadsheet called perl.xls:

        use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

        # Create a new Excel workbook
        my $workbook = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new("perl.xls");

        # Add a worksheet
        $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

        #  Add and define a format
        $format = $workbook->add_format(); # Add a format
        $format->set_bold();
        $format->set_color('red');
        $format->set_align('center');

        # Write a formatted and unformatted string, row and column notation.
        $col = $row = 0;
        $worksheet->write($row, $col, "Hi Excel!", $format);
        $worksheet->write(1,    $col, "Hi Excel!");

        # Write a number and a formula using A1 notation
        $worksheet->write('A3', 1.2345);
        $worksheet->write('A4', '=SIN(PI()/4)');
